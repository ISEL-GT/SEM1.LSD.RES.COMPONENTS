# REGISTER  
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MULTIPLE_TYPES-blue)  

> A **Register** is a sequential digital circuit used to store a group of binary bits (data). Registers are essential components in digital systems, enabling temporary data storage, data transfer, and synchronization with a clock signal.  
> - **Input Lines**: Accept the data to be stored in the register. The number of input lines corresponds to the bit-width of the register (e.g., 8-bit register has 8 input lines).  
> - **Output Lines**: Provide the stored data. Similar to input, the number of output lines matches the bit-width.  
> - **Clock Signal**: Synchronizes the operation of the register, determining when the data is captured and stored.  
> Registers are commonly used in processors, memory interfaces, and digital systems for holding data temporarily during operations.  

> [!Note]  
> Since there are many types of registers for different applications, you can select the one you want to view in the table below.
