# MULTIPLEXER
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MULTIPLE_CIRCUITS-red)


> A Multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational digital circuit that selects one of many input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. It has multiple data inputs, one or more selection inputs, and a single output.
> - The **Selection Inputs** determine which data input is passed to the output. The number of selection lines needed is determined by the number of inputs (e.g., a 4-to-1 multiplexer has 2 selection lines).
> - The **Output** is the value of the chosen data input based on the selection inputs.  
    > A multiplexer acts like a digitally controlled switch, allowing multiple data lines to share a single output line, which is useful in applications such as data routing, signal switching, and reducing the number of lines needed in a circuit.

> [!Note]
> Since there are many different types of MUXs, you can select the one you want to view in the table
